        <p>I volunteered to help design and facilitate the second iteration of <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/d-leadership/">d.leadership</a> for high school students at <a href="http://www.eastside.org/_about/mission.html">Eastside College Preparatory</a>. The d.leadership course is typically only taught to graduate students at the Stanford University <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/">d.school</a>. Students coach innovation projects with corporate teams as they experiment with their leadership styles and drive human-centered design work in their partner organizations.</p>
        <p>The students at Eastside lead corporate teams from <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/">Survey Monkey</a> and <a href="http://go.sap.com/index.html">SAP</a> through 2-week innovation projects. I participated as a full-time volunteer for 2-weeks; I was a design thinking resource and leadership mentor for three high school students. The students I worked with led a team from Survey Monkey through the design thinking process with great success!</p>
