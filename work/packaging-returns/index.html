        <h4 class="eyebrow">Objective</h4>
        <p>To find out why the Good Eggs packaging return program was making customers so nervous and uncover opportunities to improve the service.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 class="eyebrow">Motivation</h4>
        <p>The majority of support tickets coming to customer service were related to packaging concerns. Over 30% of packaging related tickets were labeled as "Nervous," meaning customers were looking for reassurance instead of asking for something specific.</p>

        <h4 class="eyebrow">About Packaging Returns</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.goodeggs.com/home">Good Eggs</a> is an online grocery delivery service specializing in local foods. Many Good Eggs products need to stay cold during delivery in compliance with food safety codes. Cold packaging is provided for any perishable items, but customers will be charged $4.99 if packaging is not returned within 30 days.</p>

    <h3>1: What does the current experience look like?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>I did a comprehensive experience audit of all aspects of our business that impact or involve packaging. Packaging affects many different user groups including customers, producers, operations, drivers, customer service, and internal software teams.</p>

    <h3>2: How can we make sense of the complexity?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>I created a service blueprint to make sense of the audit and to generate insights. Three phases directly impacted customers: Shopping, Delivery, and Maintenance.</p>

    <h3>3: What insights have we uncovered?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>The service blueprint revealed poor messaging about packaging throughout the customer experience. Information was inconsistent: text messages varied by city; cold packaging information only appeared to customers once they viewed their shopping cart and was displayed with key details hidden by default; and all packaging information disappeared after checkout.</p>

    <h3>5: What else can we learn by sharing insights with the team?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>After sharing my insights with the operations and Customer Service teams, I was surprised to learn that driver training materials are almost never used. There was no standard return process for packaging. I led an ideation session with the teams to generate new solutions for our drivers.</p>

    <h3>6: What I would have done with more time and resources</h3>
  </header>
  <p>Drivers at Good Eggs make deliveries using a custom app. During my research, I found that the packaging interface in the app was imprecise: if drivers selected "Yes" (the customer returned <em>any</em> packaging), all of a customer's outstanding packaging returns would be cleared. Originally, the addition of this toggle reduced customer complaints. However, it also undermined the importance of packaging retrieval, resulting in more lost packaging. With more time, I would have redesigned the interface to record specific quantities and reduce lost packaging.</p>
