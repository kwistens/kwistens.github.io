        <h4 class="eyebrow">Objective</h4>
        <p>To design a tool for the Good Eggs customer service team to increase response speed and improve the customer experience when items are missing from an order.</p>

      <div>
        <h4 class="eyebrow">Motivation</h4>
        <p>In total, our 4 customer service teams were spending at least 18 hours each day notifying customers of missing items. The original work flow was tedious, stressful, and error-prone.</p>

        <h4 class="eyebrow">About Missing Items</h4>
        <p><a href="https://www.goodeggs.com/home">Good Eggs</a> is an online grocery delivery service specializing in local foods. Good Eggs carries fresh products from hundreds of small local growers and producers. Delivering each day, there are always missing items due to volatile weather, oven breakdowns etc.</p>

    <h3>1: How do we currently address missing items?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>While shadowing the customer service team, I found the process had 3 phases: Assign, Respond, and Confirm. Although the team had access to a missing items dashboard, it was among 4 digital tools used in a tedious process that required constant coordination.</p>

    <h3>2: Can we reduce steps and complexity?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>Using several paper prototypes, I explored different ways of automating the process and asked the customer service team for feedback. The most effective prototypes were those that condensed each phase into one step. From there, I refined the information hierarchy. I observed that team problem solving in Phase 1 was organized by missing item and in Phase 3 by customer. Concepts I tested reflected these mental models in the heirarchy of my sketches.</p>

    <h3>3: How can we build the desired tools?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>After refining the features and hierarchy with customer service, I created several iterations of wireframes with feedback from engineers. My adjustments accommodated for technical limitations related to complex sorting and data models.</p>

    <h3>4: How can we polish the experience for customer service?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>After adjusting for technical constraints, I made design adjustments to reinforce the information hierarchy. With feedback from customer service, I designed collapsing sections, highlight colors, and smart defaults.</p>

    <h3>5: How can we deliver a better customer experience?</h3>
  </header>

  <p>After polishing the tool, I tackled the customer experience. The original emails sent to customers were plain text paragraphs manually written by the customer service team. The modular email was designed to be easily scannable and to reduce engineering complexity.</p>
