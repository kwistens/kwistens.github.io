        <h4 class="eyebrow">Objective</h4>
        <p>To help the CEO of an San Francisco startup understand his impact on team culture, unite a scattered team, and set up sustainable practices for process prototyping.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 class="eyebrow">Motivation</h4>
        <p>The ten person startup team is an even split of local and remote workers, many of whom are contractors. The team felt increasing pressure to take on more work as they continued to miss deadlines. The CEO wanted to improve work flow and morale before scaling the business further.</p>

        <p>The startup is still in stealth mode and wished to remain anonymous.</p>

    <h3>1: What change does the team want?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>I facilitated the team's first-ever retrospectives, daily standups, and feedback sessions. I identified team highs, lows, and questions, and created an action plan for next steps.</p>

    <h3>2: How can we quantitatively measure change?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>In our feedback sessions, the team identified the Monday all-hands meeting as the their "lowest performing meeting." To better understand the meeting's dynamics, we audited long each person spoke and the time spent covering different topics. After auditing these meetings, we noted low participation from remote workers. This prompted a prototyping session to establish remote meeting guidelines. Some of these improvements included microphone etiquette, backlighting guidelines, and directed questions.</p>

    <h3>3: How have changes been perceived by the team?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>To better understand communication and agenda changes, I asked the team to fill out a journey map of the all-hands meeting. We found ending with kudos was very positive and that the lowest moments were during conversations that were not inclusive of the entire team. These findings prompted positivity experiments, including an entire channel on Slack for small celebrations.</p>

    <h3>4: How can the team continue to own process prototyping? </h3>
  </header>
  <p>As the 10-week project came to an end, we began transferring responsibility and ownership to the new VP of Engineering. We collected all of the team's ideas and feedback into a format that helped him prioritize and schedule ongoing projects.</p>
