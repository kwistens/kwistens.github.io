        <h4 class="eyebrow">Objective</h4>
        <p>To design an app that could automatically find the best time for a large group to meet, while accounting for each person's dynamic schedule.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4 class="eyebrow">Motivation</h4>
        <p>During our design research, we found the most frustrating aspect of group coordination is back-and-forth scheduling. Groups would get close to finding an optimal time, only to find a last minute conflict that would restart the process. This resulted in email, Facebook, and group text message threads that seemed never-ending.</p>

        <p>Twine is the name of the final app concept. It was created over a 6 month period as a senior project in the Stanford University Product Design program.</p>

    <h3>1: How are people coordinating in groups?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>During interviews, we found most group indecision came from a desire to please: people claimed to be available and flexible even if they were not. This meant verbal claims didn't match the realities of the calendar, so we tested features that automatically integrated individual availability.</p>

    <h3>2: How can we design for our audience's needs?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>I explored many different features and interfaces by sketching and then created interactive prototypes. When collecting feedback, we learned people wanted to remind their friends to RSVP by a certain date but felt awkward policing the deadline. We created a "nudge" feature so these awkward reminders could be handled automatically by the app.</p>

    <h3>3: How should it look? What should it say?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>We also learned via prototyping that colloquial descriptions for timing worked best. For example, you could schedule coffee "sometime this weekend." We also aimed to design clear, simple interactions, with a bright, friendly color scheme.</p>

    <h3>4: How should we build our app?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>To further explore our concept, we began building out the application. I helped with calendar integration and the design of our data models.</p>

    <h3>5: How do we tell our story?</h3>
  </header>
  <p>To clearly communicate how the app could fit into the lives of our audience, I wrote marketing messaging and a video script for a promotional video.</p>
